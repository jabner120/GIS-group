    "1. [Opportunity Insights - Life Expectancy](https://opportunityinsights.org/paper/lifeexpectancy/): Opportunity Insights assesses the linkage between socioeconomic status and health outcomes through analyzing anonymized earnings data with mortality records. Chetty et al. ultimately use Census data to construct an average life expectancy for a metro area by income, and identify other corresponding environmental factors associated with life expectancy and income. \n",
    "2. [LA County - Median Income by Census Tract](https://geohub.lacity.org/datasets/lacounty::median-income-and-ami-census-tract/about): this data source is provided by LA GeoHub and averages the median household income by census tract within Los Angeles County. The dataset also contains an index which classifies census tracts from “Extremely Low Income” to “Above Moderate Income”.\n",
